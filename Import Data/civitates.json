Built in approximately 1270, the dam formed the first connection between the settlements on the sides of the river.\nAs the dam was gradually built up it became wide enough for a town square, which remained the core of the town developing around it. Dam Square as it exists today grew out of what was originally two squares: the actual dam, called Middeldam; and Plaetse, an adjacent plaza to the west.\nThe area became a centre not only of commercial activity but also of the government, as the site of Amsterdam's town hall.",

After the Reformation in 1578 it became a Calvinist church, which it remains today. It stands in De Wallen, now Amsterdam's main red-light district.
